### Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

#### Blockchain is a distributed database stored on the nodes of a computer network. It is composed of blocks that contain sets of data. Blocks are being created periodically and are linked with each other through cryptoghrapic method. A block contains its own hash (a cryptographic number created from the block's data) and the hash of the previous block. Blockchain is secure and immutable. It means that data once entered into the blockchain cannot be changed. Blockchain is usually used to store transaction. 
#### It is very difficult or even impossible to fake data in a blockchain, because of cryptography and because of the physical and geographical distribution of the blochain's nodes. Nodes of a blockchain communicate with each other and they use so callled consensus mechanism to ensure that there exist only one single valid copy of record shared by all nodes.
#### Blockchain is public. It means that anyone can view the data on it.

### Explain what a Smart Contract is.

#### Smart contract is a programs stored on a blockchain. Once written to the blockchain it cannot be modified. It allows anonymous parties to carry out transactions and agreements without the need for a third party (e.g. bank) or external enforcement mechanism. They run when predetermined conditions are met. They can automate workflow i.e. execute a task when conditions are met.

### Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

#### A script views the state only. It cannot modify the state. It can return some value. It is free and does not cost gas. It usually has a public function main that returns a value.
#### A transaction can view and modify the state. It costs gas. It usually interacts with smart contract on the blochchain. Transaction in Cadence usually has two phases: prepare and execute.
#### In Cadence script, contracts and transactions are written separately.
